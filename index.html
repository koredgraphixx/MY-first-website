    Manchester United Football Club is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Nicknamed the Red Devils, the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, but changed its name to Manchester United in 1902. The club moved from Newton Heath to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.

Manchester United have won the joint-most trophies in English club football,[5][6] including a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, five League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. They have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each. In 1968, under the management of Matt Busby, 10 years after eight of the club's players were killed in the Munich air disaster, they became the first English club to win the European Cup. Alex Ferguson is the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38 trophies, including 13 league titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions League titles, between 1986 and 2013.[7][8][9] In the 1998–99 season, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the European treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League.[10] In winning the UEFA Europa League under José Mourinho in 2016–17, they also became one of five clubs to have won the original three main UEFA club competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup).

Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world,[11][12] and has rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Leeds United. Manchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world for 2016–17, with an annual revenue of €676.3 million,[13] and the world's third most valuable football club in 2019, valued at £3.15 billion ($3.81 billion).[14] After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was taken private in 2005 after a purchase by Malcolm Glazer valued at almost £800 million, of which over £500 million of borrowed money became the club's debt.[15] From 2012, some shares of the club were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, although the Glazer family retains overall ownership and control of the club.

    <li><b>ILLUSTRIOUS HISTORY</b></li>
    <p>
        Different from the red and black that we are used to seeing the Red Devils adorn, the club was founded in 1878 by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway as Newton Heath, with a green-and-gold-coloured kit. In 1902, following a winding-up order, the club was reinstated as Manchester United and won its first league title in 1908 and another one in 1911.

United then became a yo-yo club, moving up and down the tiers of English football and it was not until 1952 that they won their next league crown under the legendary Sir Matt Busby, who transformed the club into a European giant and won multiple trophies in his 24-year reign despite the Munich Air Disaster of 1958. 

The year 1967 saw United win their seventh league title before embarking on another dry run where they had to watch rivals Liverpool sweep up a multitude of trophies. All that changed with the arrival of a certain Scotsman from Aberdeen in 1986 as he transformed United into the world’s biggest football team and knocked the Reds off their perch to take United to an unprecedented 20 league titles.
    </p>
    <li><b> Sir Alex Ferguson</b> </li>
    <p>
        The Scotsman was none other than Sir Alex Ferguson, arguably the greatest manager to have ever graced the beautiful game.

His name is synonymous with United as he changed their course and led them to 13 top division crowns as well as two Champions League trophies, including the treble of the 1998-99 season, where the Red Devils completed the trio of the league, FA Cup and European Cup wins. 

He was on the verge of being sacked three-and-a-half years into his job but was saved by victory in the 1990 FA Cup final replay. He never looked back after that, as he built a strong team year-after-year, with a focus on giving adequate chances to academy recruits.

Club legends such as Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, David Beckham and Gary Neville all emerged under Fergie and formed the core of the United side that was to dominate English football for two decades.

He has the mind of a footballing genius coupled with world-class man-management skills. And yet, my favourite aspect of him is his mannerisms and the way he carried himself and spoke to the press and his players.

Growing up, I have spent countless hours watching him celebrate with utmost joy, get red-faced with anger and also get under the referee’s skin with his trademark ‘pointing to the wristwatch’ routine. He epitomises the club like no other and all football fans are ever grateful to him for his contributions to the sport.
    </p>
    <li><b>The Theatre of Dreams</b></li>
    <p>
        The Red Devils’ home stadium Old Trafford is one of the most iconic in world football and the largest for any club in England. It was christened as ‘The Theatre of Dreams’ by United great and all-time top scorer Sir Bobby Charlton and has been the club’s home turf since 1910, except in the 1940s, when it was bombed by the Germans in World War II.
        Every United fan dreams of visiting the hallowed grounds of Old Trafford some day and witness United strut their stuff on the pitch. Even on television, one can understand why the stadium is so special as the fans chant ‘United! United!’ to spur their team on.

The atmosphere during a game is truly unique and on an important occasion such as a European fixture, it is truly a sight to behold.
    </p>
    <li><b> Attacking style of play</b></li>
    <p>
        After Sir Alex’s retirement, there has been much hue and cry about United’s style of play under David Moyes and Louis van Gaal. And it’s hard to blame the two too much as, during its peak, United’s attacking displays were second to none.
        With Fergie at the helm, United’s attacks were characterised by swift forward passing, efficient wing play and moments of individual brilliance along with an innate ability to generate a blistering counter-attack out of nowhere.

If such is the standard that is expected of United in every game, it is easy to understand why Louis van Gaal has one of the toughest jobs in world football.
    </p>
    <li><b> Never-say-die attitude</b></li>
    <p>
        Throughout their history, the one thing that has always stayed with United has been their never-say-die attitude and the ability to come back strong from the worst possible situations, both on and off the pitch
        In 1958, eight United first team players lost their lives in a plane crash in Munich and manager Matt Busby along with captain Bobby Charlton were grievously injured in the accident. 

The crash not only derailed their title ambitions that year but also destroyed the core of what was to be one of the greatest generations of players that English football had ever seen. However, in true United fashion, Busby rebuilt the entire team in just 10 years at the pinnacle of which the Red Devils lifted the European Cup in 1968 at Wembley.

‘You can never write Manchester United off!’ is one of the best quotes to depict what the team is all about on the pitch. Under Ferguson, it was almost as if it were natural that United would find that winning goal late in the game, so much so that injury time in a United match came to be known as Fergie Time.

    <li> <b>heatre of Dreams</b>  </li>
    <p>
        Old Trafford, which is Manchester United’s home ground, was nicknamed “The Theatre of Dreams” by United legend and England’s greatest footballer, Sir Bobby Charlton. Though not the official name of the stadium, it’s occasionally referred to in this way. However, some people (non United fans to be specific) believe that the name is self-aggrandizing and thus see it as an attempt to establish superiority over others.
    </p>
    <li><b>Commercialization</b></li>
    <p>
        United is one of the richest sports clubs and part of their wealth comes from selling club merchandise. However, they are among the Premier League clubs that charge the highest for their tickets. They also keep changing their kits constantly, causing fans to keep buying new replicas which also don’t come cheap. These factors have led many to believe that United only care about making more money and aren’t considerate towards those who struggle to pay for these goods.
    </p>
    <li><b>Fergie Time</b></li>
    <p>
        This refers to the habit of referees adding more time to matches where United needed a goal. It usually started with Sir Alex Ferguson pointing at his watch towards the end of the match and some referees would then add them some more time. What made things worse was the fact that United tended to score during this time and thus occasionally went on to win the match. This was highly frowned upon by managers and opposition players whose team dropped points due to such an occurrence. Ferguson later claimed that he did it to create tension for the opposition.
    </p>
    <li><b>Abnormal Luck</b></li>
    <p>
        United have a history of grinding out unexpected wins. They’ve been in situations where they were about to lose a match only to come back and win it or salvage a draw, sometimes at the dying moments of a match. One notable example is their miraculous victory over Bayern Munich in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final where they were losing 1-0 only for them to score two goals in injury time.

There’s also the 2009/10 season where they had 10 own goals scored by their opponents. It might not seem like a big deal until you consider the fact that the own goals happened to be their third highest goal scorer in the Premier League. It thus irked some people that United tended to get these “magic” wins on many occasions.
    </p>
    <li><b>Player Infidelities</b></li>
    <p>
        United has had its fair share of sex scandals over the years but the ones that have brought about the most condemnation are those that involve cheating on a spouse or partner. United players have been at the centre of some of the biggest sex scandals and this has brought the club some negative attention. The fact is that the people’s disapproval usually extends to the player’s club and thus United have gained antis due to their player’s behaviour.
